## Background

Reproducibility and collaboration are fundamental to Antarctic and Southern Ocean science, and fit seamlessly with the Antarctic Treaty's position that "to the greatest extent feasible and practicable ... scientific observations and results from Antarctica shall be exchanged and made freely available".

[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) is a a non-profit initiative founded in 2011 that promotes open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. This is achieved by promoting R software tools that lower the barriers to working with scientific data sources, creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse community, and building the capacity of software users and developers.

Starting in late 2017, the [Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research](https://www.scar.org/) has been collaborating with rOpenSci to build these aspects of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean science communities. This includes supporting the development of R packages to meet Antarctic science needs, guides for R users and developers, and active fora for open discussions about using R in Antarctic and Southern Ocean science. This collaboration has been coordinated through the [Expert Group on Antarctic Biodiversity Informatics](https://www.scar.org/science/egabi/abi/).
