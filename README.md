## Background

Reproducibility and collaboration are [fundamental to Antarctic and Southern Ocean science](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-05369-6), and fit seamlessly with the [Antarctic Treaty's](https://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm) provision that "to the greatest extent feasible and practicable ... scientific observations and results from Antarctica shall be exchanged and made freely available".

[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) is a a non-profit initiative founded in 2011 that promotes open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. This is achieved by promoting R software tools that lower the barriers to working with scientific data sources, creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse community, and building the capacity of software users and developers.

Starting in late 2017, the [Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research](https://www.scar.org/) has been collaborating with rOpenSci to build these aspects of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean science communities. This includes supporting the development of R packages to meet Antarctic science needs, guides for R users and developers, and active fora for open discussions about using R in Antarctic and Southern Ocean science. This collaboration has been coordinated through the [Expert Group on Antarctic Biodiversity Informatics](https://www.scar.org/science/egabi/abi/).

## Get involved
